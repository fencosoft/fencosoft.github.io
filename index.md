# DataGen API Reference & Tutorial

Welcome to the DataGen API documentation page. 
Please review this document thoroughly before posting requests to the API.

* * *
## Url Parameters
The only required parameter is quantity.

For example, if you would like 500 documents returned you would post your request like this:

```
/api/v1/generate/500
```


## Request Body
The request body requires the `schema` object.
Within this object you will define your entire schema and data types for each field.

Basic request example:
```json
{
  "schema": {
    "desiredFieldName": {
      "type": "int",
        "min": 100,
        "max": 2000
	}
  }
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "requestId": "148c4f3b-d13e-4e76-b6fb-fa3bdf3e08b5",
  "success": true,
  "recordCount": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      "desiredFieldName": 1322
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, we've requested 1 document to be returned with the given schema and the response contains an array called `data`
with a single document. The returned document has the field name that was defined in the schema and a randomly generated integer between 100 and 2000.

The `schema` object is structured like a typical JSON document.
